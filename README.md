# Project name
Hello_Embedded_2501-A Smart Emotion-Aware Coffee Machine

This is a repository established by a group of interesting people to create something truly enjoyable. We are thrilled and dedicated to this little charming hand-made craft.

The project is a smart coffee machine based on the Raspberry PI 5 to recognize images and heart rate signals, adjust the coffee formula to improve the quality of the user's mood.

An intelligent coffee brewing system that understands your physical and emotional state before making the perfect cup — just for you.

## Overview

This project was developed by Group 17 as part of the **Real-Time Embedded Coding** course at the University of Glasgow (2025). Our system integrates **biological signal monitoring** and **emotional state recognition** to personalize coffee recommendations.

The coffee machine not only detects your presence but also monitors heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and facial expressions to deduce your emotional state. Based on this, it recommends a drink and automatically starts brewing — providing a smart and delightful coffee experience.

### Real-time Interaction
- **Wake-up Detection:** Uses PIR (e.g., HC-SR501) infrared sensors to wake the system when a user approaches.
- **Sleep Detection:** Enters low-power mode when no human presence is detected after some time.

### Emotional & Physical State Recognition
- **Camera module** analyzes facial expressions (happy/unhappy).
- **Pulse oximeter module** detects real-time heart rate and SpO₂ levels.

### Smart Coffee Making
- Personalized coffee suggestions based on user mood and health data.
- Manual override: users can choose their favorite drink manually.
- Friendly on-screen interaction and music during brewing.

### Status Feedback
- Notifies user when coffee is ready.
- Uses weight/laser sensors to detect cup removal.
- Automatically resets to ready mode after user interaction.

## Introduction
This project combines image recognition technology and biological signal detection technology. By detecting the user's current facial expression, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels, it evaluates the user's current emotional and health status, and recommends and automatically makes coffee suitable for the user's physical condition. In addition, the system supports a low-power mode, automatically entering sleep mode when there is no user interaction, saving energy. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a low-power smart coffee machine that can make coffee tailored to the user's psychological and physiological condition.

## Working_Environment
Ubuntu 22.04.5 on Raspberry5 for now.
Expected to be deployed on different platform.

## Usage & Example
Using the smart coffee machine is very simple, and the user only needs to follow these steps:
1. **Start the coffee machine**: When the user approaches the coffee machine, it will automatically wake up from sleep mode and enter the "Ready" state.
2. **Emotion and health recognition**: When the user stands in front of the coffee machine, the system will automatically recognize the user's facial expressions and use sensors to obtain the current heart rate and blood oxygen levels.
3. **Recipe recommendation and coffee making**: Based on the user's emotion and health status, the system will automatically recommend a suitable coffee recipe and begin making it.
4. **Completion notification**: Once the coffee is made, the system will emit a notification sound to remind the user to pick up the coffee.
